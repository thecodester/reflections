When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Collaboration
Working on many computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Not really sure. Because you want to be left alone while you work on your feature and not be bothered by other changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork=clone a repository from GitHub to another GitHub account (nothing happens locally) --> I want to take someone else's project and do my own thing but still give credit to the source.
clone=make a copy of a repository either from GitHub to local or local to local. Generally when I want to work on a GitHub project, do stuff locally, and then push back to GitHub.
branch=In the same project, create another codeline for creating a new feature or bug fix, which will then generally be merged back into the main codeline.
